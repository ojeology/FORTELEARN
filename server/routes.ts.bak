Maximum welcome bonus amount is ₦1,000,000. It expires after exactly 90 days of the first deposit. To qualify for the Welcome Bonus credit, a customer's bet must include at least 3 events with total odds of 3.00 or more. Once conditions are met, 2% of the wagered amount is moved to the main account. Customers can find their welcome bonus balance on the dedicated Welcome Bonus page. Note that bets placed at branches do not qualify for this online bonus. Only bets placed online using a registered account are eligible for this promotion. If you deposit ₦500, you get ₦1,500 bonus. If you deposit ₦10,000, you get ₦30,000 bonus. The 2% move happens every time you place a qualifying bet until the bonus is exhausted or expires.",

The payout depends on the remaining total odds (after removing the lost event and any voided events). The scale is as follows: 75.00 - 149.99 yields 1x Stake, 150.00 - 299.99 yields 2x Stake, and 300+ yields 3x Stake back to your account. If multiple events are voided/cut, the cashback may be suspended or recalculated based on the remaining active odds. This bonus ensures that even if one game lets you down, you don't lose your entire stake. For example, if you staked ₦1,000 and your remaining odds are 200, you get ₦2,000 back.",
