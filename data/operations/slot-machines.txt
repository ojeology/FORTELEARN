1. Slot Machine Basics

Each branch slot machine contains 12 unique games. Winnings are calculated based on paylines—specific patterns across the reels where matching symbols must land. Mystery/Wild Symbols are special symbols that can substitute for others to create winning combinations, often disregarding standard payline rules.

2. Operational Guidelines & Troubleshooting

· Power or Game Interruption: If the power fails during a bonus round, all customer winnings are calculated and paid out in full. If a machine goes offline, all remaining credits are automatically refunded to the customer's linked card.
· Resolving Disputed Transactions:
  1. Use the slot keys to access the operator menu.
  2. Check the Financial Transaction log to find the exact amount and type of the last transaction.
