1. Slot Machine Basics

Each branch slot machine contains 12 unique games. Winnings are calculated based on paylines鈥攕pecific patterns across the reels where matching symbols must land. Mystery/Wild Symbols are special symbols that can substitute for others to create winning combinations, often disregarding standard payline rules.

2. Operational Guidelines & Troubleshooting

These procedures ensure customer funds are always protected and issues are resolved correctly.

路 Power or Game Interruption: If the power fails during a bonus round, all customer winnings are calculated and paid out in full. If a machine goes offline, all remaining credits are automatically refunded to the customer's linked card.
路 Resolving Disputed Transactions: If a customer reports missing funds due to a network glitch:
  1. Use the slot keys to access the operator menu, ensuring the game is not in demo mode.
  2. Check the Financial Transaction log to find the exact amount and type (deposit/withdrawal) of the last transaction.
  3. Review the Game History log to verify all gameplay and withdrawal activity, allowing you to confirm the account balance and rectify the issue.
路 Reporting a Faulty Machine: If a slot machine has network issues or will not start:
  1. Report it in the dedicated slot issue group.
  2. Include: Branch Name, Slot Machine ID, a clear photo of the machine, and a description of the issue.
