Important Rule on Maximum Payout (₦200 Million):
The system will not allow a potential win to exceed ₦200,000,000 on a single bet slip. If your selections create a potential win over this limit, one of two things happens automatically:

1. Your total stake is reduced to an amount that brings the potential payout down to ₦200,000,000.
2. If the required stake reduction would make your bet lower than the minimum stake, you must remove some selections from your bet slip to proceed.
