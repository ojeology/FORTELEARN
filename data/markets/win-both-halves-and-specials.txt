1. Win Both Halves

· The Core Concept: You are not betting on the full-time score. You are betting on a team to outscore their opponent in each separate 45-minute half.
· How It Works: The match is split into two independent periods. Your team must score more goals than the opponent in the first 45 minutes AND again in the second 45 minutes.
· Critical Rule: The halftime score is the score of the first half only. The "second half score" is calculated by subtracting the halftime score from the full-time score.
· Detailed Example:
  · You bet $10 on "Manchester City to Win Both Halves" vs. Southampton.
  · Scenario A (LOSE):
    · Halftime Score: Man City 2 - 0 Southampton. (City wins 1st half 2-0).
    · Full-Time Score: Man City 3 - 1 Southampton.
    · Second Half Score: (3-1) - (2-0) = 1-1.
    · Analysis: City won the 1st half (2-0). They did not win the 2nd half (it was 1-1). Therefore, the "Win Both Halves" bet LOSES.
  · Scenario B (WIN):
    · Halftime Score: Man City 1 - 0 Southampton. (City wins 1st half).
    · Full-Time Score: Man City 4 - 0 Southampton.
    · Second Half Score: (4-0) - (1-0) = 3-0.
    · Analysis: City won the 1st half (1-0) AND won the 2nd half (3-0). Therefore, the bet WINS.
