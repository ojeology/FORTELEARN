🎯 MILESTONE 3: HANDICAP BETTING (SPREADS)

Handicaps give a virtual advantage or disadvantage to a team to make betting on a one-sided match more balanced and interesting.

1. Asian Handicap

· The Core Concept: This handicap uses quarter-goal increments (.25, .75) to eliminate the possibility of a draw (a "push"). Your stake is either fully won or fully lost. The .25 split means half your stake goes on one line and half on another.
· How It Works: A team is given a negative handicap (they must overcome it) or a positive handicap (they receive it).
· Common Lines & Outcomes:
  · -0.25: Win: Team wins. Draw: Lose half stake. Loss: Lose full stake.
  · -0.5: Win: Bet wins. Draw or Loss: Bet loses.
  · -0.75: Win by 2+: Full win. Win by 1: Half stake wins, half is refunded. Draw/Loss: Full loss.
  · -1.5: The favorite must win by 2 or more goals. Win by 2+: Win. Win by 1, Draw, Loss: Lose.

2. European Handicap (3-Way Handicap)

· The Core Concept: Uses whole numbers and offers three outcomes: Home Win, Draw, or Away Win after the handicap is applied. There is no push or split stake.
· How It Works: The handicap (e.g., -1, -2, +1) is applied to the final score to create a new "handicap result."
· Example in Practice (European -1):
  · Final Score: Man City 2 - 0 Everton. Apply handicap: (2 - 1) = 1 to 0. Handicap Result: Man City wins. Your bet on 1 WINS.
  · Final Score: Man City 1 - 0 Everton. Handicap result: (1 - 1) = 0-0 → a Draw. Your bet on 1 LOSES (the X would have won).
· Agent Insight: "A -1 handicap means a 1-0 win for the favorite results in a draw for your bet."
