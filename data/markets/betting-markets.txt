🎯 MILESTONE 1: THE 1X2 SYSTEM & BASIC VARIATIONS

This system defines the three possible outcomes of a match. Every other bet is built upon this logic.

1. 1X2 (The Match Result / Full-Time Result)

· The Core Concept: This is the simplest and most common bet. You are predicting the official result of the match after regular time (typically 90 minutes plus added time). Extra time and penalties do not count unless specifically stated.
· The Symbols Explained:
  · 1 : This represents the Home Team. A bet on 1 wins if the home team wins the match.
  · X : This represents a Draw. A bet on X wins if the match ends with both teams scoring the same number of goals.
  · 2 : This represents the Away Team. A bet on 2 wins if the away team wins the match.
· Example in Practice:
  · Match: Manchester United (1) vs. Chelsea (2)
  · You bet $10 on 1 (Home) at odds of 2.50.
  · If the result is: Manchester United wins 2-1 → You WIN. Your return is $10 x 2.50 = $25.
  · If the result is: Draw 1-1 or Chelsea wins 0-1 → You LOSE your $10 stake.
· Agent Insight: This is often the first bet a new customer will place. Ensure they understand that 1 is always the team listed first/on the left, which is the home team.

2. Draw No Bet (DNB)

· The Core Concept: This is a safer version of the 1X2 bet. It removes the possibility of a draw from the equation. You are betting on a team to win, and if the match ends in a draw, your stake is returned (a "push").
· How It Works: It's presented as two options: Home or Away.
  · Bet on "Home": You win if the home team wins. You get your money back if it's a draw.
  · Bet on "Away": You win if the away team wins. You get your money back if it's a draw.
· Example in Practice:
  · Match: Arsenal (Home) vs. Tottenham (Away). You think Arsenal will win but a draw is possible.
  · You bet $10 on "Home" (Draw No Bet) at odds of 1.90.
  · If the result is: Arsenal wins 1-0 → You WIN. Return = $10 x 1.90 = $19.
  · If the result is: Draw 2-2 → You GET YOUR STAKE BACK. You receive $10.
  · If the result is: Tottenham wins 0-1 → You LOSE your $10 stake.
· Agent Insight: Recommend this to customers who are confident a team won't lose but want insurance against a draw. The odds are lower than the standard 1 or 2 in the 1X2 market because of the safety net.

3. Double Chance (DC)

· The Core Concept: This bet allows you to cover two of the three possible outcomes in a single bet, significantly increasing your chance of winning (but with lower odds).
· The Combinations:
  · 1X : Home Win OR Draw. You win if the home team does not lose.
  · 12 : Home Win OR Away Win. You win if the match does not end in a draw. (Sometimes called "To Win Either Half" in a different context, but here it's simply "No Draw").
  · X2 : Draw OR Away Win. You win if the away team does not lose.
· Example in Practice:
  · Match: Liverpool (1) vs. Manchester City (2). It's a tight game.
  · You bet $10 on 1X (Double Chance) at odds of 1.30.
  · If the result is: Liverpool wins (1) OR the match is a draw (X) → You WIN. Return = $10 x 1.30 = $13.
  · If the result is: Only if Manchester City wins (2) → You LOSE your $10.
· Agent Insight: This is a popular "safer" bet for customers. It's crucial to explain that covering two outcomes means the potential payout is much smaller than betting on a single outcome.

---
🎯 MILESTONE 2: TOTALS (OVER/UNDER) & GOAL-RELATED MARKETS

These bets focus on the total number of goals scored in the match, regardless of which team wins.

1. Over/Under (Total Goals) - Full Match

· The Core Concept: You are betting on whether the total number of goals scored by both teams combined will be over or under a number set by the bookmaker (the "line").
· How It Works: The most common line is 2.5 goals. The .5 is crucial—it eliminates the possibility of a push (tie).
  · Over 2.5: You win if the total goals are 3 or more. (e.g., 2-1, 3-0, 2-2).
  · Under 2.5: You win if the total goals are 2 or fewer. (e.g., 1-0, 0-0, 2-0).
· Other Common Lines: 1.5, 3.5, 4.5. The principle is the same.
· Example in Practice:
  · Match: Bayern Munich vs. Borussia Dortmund. The line is Over/Under 3.5.
  · You bet $10 on Over 3.5 goals at odds of 2.00.
  · If the result is: 3-2 (5 goals) → You WIN. Return = $10 x 2.00 = $20.
  · If the result is: 2-1 (3 goals) → You LOSE. 3 is under 3.5.
· Agent Insight: This is hugely popular. Explain the .5 clearly! A line of "3.0" would mean exactly 3 goals causes a refund, which is rare. Fortebet almost always uses .5 lines for clear outcomes.

2. Over/Under - First Half

· The Core Concept: Identical to the full-match version, but you are betting only on goals scored in the 1st half (usually minutes 1-45 plus added time).
· How It Works: Common lines are 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 goals for the first half only.
  · Over 0.5 First Half: You win if at least 1 goal is scored before halftime.
  · Under 1.5 First Half: You win if there is 0 or 1 goal in the first half.
· Agent Insight: Useful for customers who have a strong view on a team's early strategy or slow starters. Stress that 2nd half goals do not count for this bet.

3. Both Teams To Score (BTTS)

· The Core Concept: A simple "Yes" or "No" bet on whether both teams will score at least one goal each during the match.
· How It Works:
  · Yes: You win if both the home and away team score. The final score doesn't matter (e.g., 1-1, 2-1, 3-2).
  · No: You win if at least one team fails to score (e.g., 1-0, 0-0, 3-0).
· Example in Practice:
  · Match: AC Milan vs. Inter Milan.
  · You bet $10 on BTTS: Yes at odds of 1.80.
  · If the result is: 2-1, 1-1, 2-2 → You WIN.
  · If the result is: 1-0, 0-0, 2-0 → You LOSE.
· Agent Insight: This market is about both teams' attacking and defensive form, not who wins. A common advanced combination is BTTS & Over 2.5 Goals, which requires a minimum scoreline like 2-1.

4. Combination Markets (e.g., "Over 2.5 & BTTS: Yes")

· The Core Concept: A single bet that combines two conditions. Both must happen to win.
· How It Works: It's a popular pre-made selection.
  · To win "Over 2.5 & BTTS: Yes": The match must have 3+ goals AND both teams must score. (e.g., 2-1, 3-1, 2-2). A 3-0 score has Over 2.5 but NOT BTTS, so the bet loses.
· Agent Insight: These combos offer higher odds due to increased difficulty. Make sure the customer understands it's an "AND" condition, not an "OR."

 MILESTONE 3: HANDICAP BETTING (SPREADS)

Handicaps give a virtual advantage or disadvantage to a team to make betting on a one-sided match more balanced and interesting.

1. Asian Handicap (The Most Common in Soccer)

· The Core Concept: This handicap uses quarter-goal increments (.25, .75) to eliminate the possibility of a draw (a "push"). Your stake is either fully won or fully lost. The .25 split means half your stake goes on one line and half on another.
· How It Works: A team is given a negative handicap (they must overcome it) or a positive handicap (they receive it).
· Common Lines & Outcomes:

Handicap What It Means How to Read the Result
-0.25 The favorite must win. A draw results in a half loss. Win: Team wins. Draw: Lose half stake. Loss: Lose full stake.
-0.5 The favorite must win. Simple. Win: Bet wins. Draw or Loss: Bet loses.
-0.75 The favorite must win by 2+ goals for full win. A 1-goal win is a half win. Win by 2+: Full win. Win by 1: Half stake wins, half is refunded. Draw/Loss: Full loss.
-1.0 The favorite must win by at least 2 goals. A 1-goal win is a push (refund). Win by 2+: Win. Win by 1: Stake refunded. Draw/Loss: Lose.
-1.25 Favorite must win by 2+ for full win. A 1-goal win is a half loss. Win by 2+: Full win. Win by 1: Half stake lost. Draw/Loss: Full loss.
-1.5 The favorite must win by 2 or more goals. Win by 2+: Win. Win by 1, Draw, Loss: Lose.
+0.25, +0.5, etc. The opposite logic applies for the underdog. A +1.5 means the team can lose by 1 goal and your bet still wins. 

· Example in Practice (Asian -1.5):
  · Match: Brazil (-1.5) vs. Peru. Odds: 1.90.
  · You bet $10 on Brazil -1.5. Brazil starts the game "down" 0-1.5.
  · Final Score: Brazil 3 - 0 Peru. Brazil's "handicap score" is (3 - 1.5) = 1.5 to 0. You WIN. Return = $10 x 1.90 = $19.
  · Final Score: Brazil 2 - 1 Peru. Handicap score is (2 - 1.5) = 0.5 to 1. You LOSE. Brazil only won by 1 goal on the field.
· Agent Insight: This is the most important handicap system to master. Use it to advise customers on strong favorites. Explain: "You're not just betting on Brazil to win, but to win comfortably."

2. European Handicap (3-Way Handicap)

· The Core Concept: Uses whole numbers and offers three outcomes: Home Win, Draw, or Away Win after the handicap is applied. There is no push or split stake.
· How It Works: The handicap (e.g., -1, -2, +1) is applied to the final score to create a new "handicap result."
· Example in Practice (European -1):
  · Match: Manchester City (-1) vs. Everton. The market is: 1 (City wins by 2+), X (City wins by exactly 1), 2 (Everton does not lose).
  · You bet $10 on 1 (City -1 to win) at odds of 2.10.
  · Final Score: Man City 2 - 0 Everton. Apply handicap: (2 - 1) = 1 to 0. Handicap Result: Man City wins. Your bet on 1 WINS.
  · Final Score: Man City 1 - 0 Everton. Handicap result: (1 - 1) = 0-0 → a Draw. Your bet on 1 LOSES (the X would have won).
  · Final Score: Man City 0 - 0 Everton. Handicap result: (0 - 1) = -1 to 0 → an Everton win. Your bet on 1 LOSES.
· Agent Insight: Simpler for beginners to understand than Asian splits, as it mirrors the 1X2 market. Point out the key difference: "A -1 handicap means a 1-0 win for the favorite results in a draw for your bet."

3. Winning Margin

· The Core Concept: A bet on how many goals a team will win by. It combines the "who wins" and "by how much" questions.
· How It Works: You select a band or exact margin of victory for either team.
· Common Options:
  · Home to win by exactly 1 goal
  · Away to win by 2 or more goals
  · Any Team to win by exactly 2 goals
· Example in Practice:
  · Match: Liverpool vs. Aston Villa.
  · You bet $10 on "Liverpool to win by 2 or more goals."
  · Result 3-0 or 2-0: You WIN.
  · Result 1-0: You LOSE (only won by 1).
· Agent Insight: This is a good bridge between simple 1X2 and full handicap betting. It's intuitive for customers who have a strong feeling about a team's dominance



🎯 MILESTONE 4: HALF-TIME/FULL-TIME, GOAL SCORERS & SPECIALS

1. Half-Time / Full-Time (HT/FT)

· The Core Concept: You are predicting the match result at halftime AND the result at the end of the match. This is two predictions in one.
· How It Works: The nine possible combinations are: 1/1, 1/X, 1/2, X/1, X/X, X/2, 2/1, 2/X, 2/2.
  · The first letter is the Half-Time result.
  · The second letter is the Full-Time result.
· Example in Practice:
  · Match: Chelsea vs. Arsenal. You expect a tight first half but Chelsea to pull ahead later.
  · You bet $10 on X/1 (Draw at Half-Time / Chelsea Win at Full-Time) at odds of 5.00.
  · If the match is: 0-0 at halftime, and ends 2-0 to Chelsea → You WIN. Return = $10 x 5.00 = $50.
  · If Chelsea is already winning at halftime, or if they don't win, your bet loses.
· Agent Insight: This market has higher odds due to difficulty. It's perfect for customers who understand a team's "game plan" (e.g., a team known for strong second-half performances).

2. Anytime Goal Scorer

· The Core Concept: You are betting that a specific player will score at least one goal at any time during the match (including own goals? No. Own goals do not count for any player).
· How It Works: Odds are listed for each player (usually starters and key substitutes). The bet wins if the player scores once. Scoring twice doesn't pay more.
· Example in Practice:
  · Match: Barcelona vs. Real Betis.
  · You bet $10 on "Robert Lewandowski - Anytime Goal Scorer" at odds of 1.90.
  · If Lewandowski scores in the 7th, 55th, or 90th minute → You WIN.
  · If he plays but doesn't score, or doesn't play at all → You LOSE.
· Agent Insight: Always check the team sheet before placing! If a player doesn't start, the bet is usually void (check Fortebet rules). This is a fan-favorite bet.

3. First Goal Scorer

· The Core Concept: A higher-risk version. You are betting that a specific player will score the first goal of the match. If another player scores first, your bet loses—even if your player scores later.
· How It Works: Odds are higher than "Anytime." Some books offer "Last Goal Scorer" as well.
· Key Rule: If the player you select does not start the match, bets are typically void. If no goals are scored, bets are also void.
· Agent Insight: Recommend this to customers who are confident about a team's fast starts or a penalty taker. It's pure prediction.

4. Total Corners (Over/Under)

· The Core Concept: Exactly like Goal Totals, but you are betting on the total number of corner kicks awarded in the match.
· How It Works: The bookmaker sets a line (e.g., 9.5 corners). You bet Over or Under.
  · Match: A game between two attacking, wing-based teams.
  · You bet Over 10.5 Corners.
  · If the match has 11 or more corners total → You WIN.
  · If it has 10 or fewer → You LOSE.
· Agent Insight: This is a great "alternative" market when a customer has no strong opinion on the winner but knows the teams' styles (e.g., teams that cross a lot earn more corners).

5. Total Cards (Over/Under)

· The Core Concept: Betting on the total number of yellow and red cards shown by the referee. A red card usually counts as two cards.
· How It Works: A line is set (e.g., 4.5 cards). Research is key—a derby match or a referee with a strict history increases the likelihood of cards.
· Agent Insight: This appeals to customers who follow match context (rivalries, aggressive tactics, a referee's tendencies). It's another market divorced from the scoreline.

6. Odd/Even Total Goals

· The Core Concept: A simple bet on whether the sum of all goals in the match will be an Odd or an Even number.
· How It Works:
  · Odd: 1, 3, 5, 7... goals. (e.g., 1-0, 2-1, 3-2).
  · Even: 0, 2, 4, 6... goals. (e.g., 0-0, 1-1, 2-0, 3-1).
· Agent Insight: This is a pure 50/50 chance (excluding the 0-0 draw effect), so odds are very low (~1.90). It's often used as a fun add-on to another bet.

🎯 MILESTONE 5: FORTEBET COMBO BETS EXPLAINED

These bets have two conditions. Both must be correct for the bet to win.

1. Win & Over (e.g., "1 & Over 1.5")

· The Core Concept: You bet on a team to win AND for the total goals to be over a specified line.
· Common Variations:
  · 1 & Over 1.5: Home team wins AND total match goals > 1.5 (i.e., 2 or more).
  · 2 & Over 2.5: Away team wins AND total match goals > 2.5 (i.e., 3 or more).
· Example - 1 & Over 1.5:
  · You bet on Manchester United to win AND Over 1.5 total goals.
  · Winning Scores: 2-0, 2-1, 3-1 (United wins, total goals 2+).
  · Losing Scores: 1-0 (United wins, but total goals =1, not over 1.5). 2-2 (Over 1.5 is hit, but United didn't win).

2. Win & Both Teams To Score (GG) (e.g., "1 & GG")

· The Core Concept: You bet on a team to win AND for both teams to score (GG = "Goal-Goal").
· Common Variations: 1 & GG (Home Win & BTTS Yes), 2 & GG (Away Win & BTTS Yes).
· Example - 1 & GG:
  · You bet on Liverpool to win AND Both Teams To Score.
  · Winning Scores: 2-1, 3-2, 4-1 (Liverpool wins, opponent also scores).
  · Losing Scores: 2-0 (Liverpool wins, but BTTS No). 2-2 (BTTS Yes, but Liverpool didn't win).

3. Over & Both Teams To Score (e.g., "Over 2.5 & GG")

· The Core Concept: You bet on a high-scoring game where both teams contribute. This is one of the most popular combos.
· Common Variation: Over 2.5 & GG (Total goals > 2.5 AND both teams score).
· Example - Over 2.5 & GG:
  · Winning Scores: 2-1, 3-2, 2-2, 3-1 (All have 3+ goals and both teams scored).
  · Losing Scores: 3-0 (Over 2.5 Yes, but BTTS No). 1-1 (BTTS Yes, but total goals =2, not over 2.5).

4. Half-Time/Full-Time Combos (e.g., "1/1 & Over 1.5")

· The Core Concept: This combines an HT/FT prediction with another market like Over/Under.
· Common Variation: 1/1 & Over 1.5 (Home team leads at halftime AND wins at full time AND total goals > 1.5).
· Example: For 1/1 & Over 1.5 to win, the match could be 1-0 at HT and end 2-0 or 2-1.

5. Other Fortebet-Specific Combo Buttons

Based on their promotions, look out for automated combo buttons like:

· "Home Win & Over 2.5": A single click adds all matches where the home team is expected to win in a high-scoring game.
· "Away Win & BTTS: Yes": Adds all matches where the away team is expected to win but both teams score.


 Betting Markets Master Checklist

Market Name Covered In Milestone? Core Explanation & Winning Conditions
Home Team to Score Yes (Implied in BTTS). Betting "Yes" wins if the home team scores at least one goal, regardless of the final result. A 1-0, 2-1, or 1-1 scoreline all win.
Away Team to Score Yes (Implied in BTTS). Betting "Yes" wins if the away team scores at least one goal. A 0-1, 2-2, or 1-2 scoreline all win.
Both Teams to Score (BTTS / "GG") Yes (Milestone 2, Section 3). Yes: Both home AND away team score (e.g., 1-1, 2-1). No: At least one team fails to score (e.g., 1-0, 0-0).
Win Either Half Yes (Mentioned in Double Chance context). Betting on a team to win either the 1st OR the 2nd half (the 45-minute period). They can lose the other half or draw it. The full-time result doesn't matter.
Win Both Halves Needs Detail. Betting on a team to win both the 1st AND the 2nd half (based on the score in each 45-minute segment). This usually requires a strong dominance.   Example: A team winning 1-0 at HT and 2-0 at FT won both halves (1-0, then 1-0 in 2nd). A team drawing 0-0 at HT but winning 2-0 at FT did NOT win both halves.
Half Time / Full Time (HT/FT) Yes (Milestone 4, Section 1). Predicting the result at Halftime (1/X/2) AND at Full-Time (1/X/2). The 9 combos (1/1, 1/X, 1/2, X/1, X/X, X/2, 2/1, 2/X, 2/2) were explained.

🔍 Deep Dive: Win Both Halves

· The Core Concept: You are not betting on the full-time score. You are betting on a team to outscore their opponent in each separate 45-minute half.
· How It Works: The match is split into two independent periods. Your team must score more goals than the opponent in the first 45 minutes AND again in the second 45 minutes.
· Critical Rule: The halftime score is the score of the first half only. The "second half score" is calculated by subtracting the halftime score from the full-time score.
· Detailed Example:
  · You bet $10 on "Manchester City to Win Both Halves" vs. Southampton.
  · Scenario A (WIN):
    · Halftime Score: Man City 2 - 0 Southampton. (City wins 1st half 2-0).
    · Full-Time Score: Man City 3 - 1 Southampton.
    · Second Half Score: (3-1) - (2-0) = 1-1.
    · Analysis: City won the 1st half (2-0). They did not win the 2nd half (it was 1-1). Therefore, the "Win Both Halves" bet LOSES.

  · Scenario B (LOSE):
    · Halftime Score: Man City 1 - 0 Southampton. (City wins 1st half).
    · Full-Time Score: Man City 4 - 0 Southampton.
    · Second Half Score: (4-0) - (1-0) = 3-0.
    · Analysis: City won the 1st half (1-0) AND won the 2nd half (3-0). Therefore, the bet WINS.


E = Home Win X = Draw 2 = Away Win Your selected outcome is the final result after 90 mins. Match: Arsenal vs. Spurs. Bet 1 (Arsenal). Win: 2-0, 3-1. Lose: 1-1, 0-1.
Draw No Bet Home or Away to win. Draw = Money Back. Your team wins. If draw, stake is refunded. Bet: Arsenal (Home). Win: 1-0. Push (Refund): 0-0. Lose: 0-1.
Double Chance Cover 2 of 3 outcomes. 1X: Home wins or draws. 12: Either team wins. X2: Away wins or draws. Bet: 1X (Arsenal). Win: 1-0, 0-0. Lose: 0-1.

Category 2: Goal-Based Markets (How Many? Who Scores?)

Market Your Bet Means... Wins If... Classic Example
Over/Under (e.g., 2.5) Total goals in match. Over 2.5: 3+ goals scored. Under 2.5: 0,1, or 2 goals. Line: Over 2.5. Win: 2-1, 3-0. Lose: 1-0, 1-1.
Both Teams to Score (BTTS) Yes/No. Yes: Both teams score. No: At least one fails. Win: 1-1, 2-1. Lose: 1-0, 0-0.
