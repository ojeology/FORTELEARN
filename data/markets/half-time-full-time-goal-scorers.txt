🎯 MILESTONE 4: HALF-TIME/FULL-TIME, GOAL SCORERS & SPECIALS

1. Half-Time / Full-Time (HT/FT)

· The Core Concept: You are predicting the match result at halftime AND the result at the end of the match. This is two predictions in one.
· How It Works: The nine possible combinations are: 1/1, 1/X, 1/2, X/1, X/X, X/2, 2/1, 2/X, 2/2.
  · The first letter is the Half-Time result.
  · The second letter is the Full-Time result.
· Example: X/1 means Draw at Half-Time / Home Win at Full-Time.

2. Anytime Goal Scorer

· The Core Concept: You are betting that a specific player will score at least one goal at any time during the match. Own goals do not count for any player.
· How It Works: The bet wins if the player scores once. Scoring twice doesn't pay more.

3. First Goal Scorer

· The Core Concept: You are betting that a specific player will score the first goal of the match. If another player scores first, your bet loses—even if your player scores later.
· Key Rule: If the player you select does not start the match, bets are typically void. If no goals are scored, bets are also void.
