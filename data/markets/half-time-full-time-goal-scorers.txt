🎯 MILESTONE 4: HALF-TIME/FULL-TIME, GOAL SCORERS & SPECIALS

1. Half-Time / Full-Time (HT/FT)

· The Core Concept: You are predicting the match result at halftime AND the result at the end of the match. This is two predictions in one.
· How It Works: The nine possible combinations are: 1/1, 1/X, 1/2, X/1, X/X, X/2, 2/1, 2/X, 2/2.
  · The first letter is the Half-Time result.
  · The second letter is the Full-Time result.
· Example in Practice:
  · Match: Chelsea vs. Arsenal. You expect a tight first half but Chelsea to pull ahead later.
  · You bet $10 on X/1 (Draw at Half-Time / Chelsea Win at Full-Time) at odds of 5.00.
  · If the match is: 0-0 at halftime, and ends 2-0 to Chelsea → You WIN. Return = $10 x 5.00 = $50.
  · If Chelsea is already winning at halftime, or if they don't win, your bet loses.
· Agent Insight: This market has higher odds due to difficulty. It's perfect for customers who understand a team's "game plan" (e.g., a team known for strong second-half performances).

2. Anytime Goal Scorer

· The Core Concept: You are betting that a specific player will score at least one goal at any time during the match (including own goals? No. Own goals do not count for any player).
· How It Works: Odds are listed for each player (usually starters and key substitutes). The bet wins if the player scores once. Scoring twice doesn't pay more.
· Example in Practice:
  · Match: Barcelona vs. Real Betis.
  · You bet $10 on "Robert Lewandowski - Anytime Goal Scorer" at odds of 1.90.
  · If Lewandowski scores in the 7th, 55th, or 90th minute → You WIN.
  · If he plays but doesn't score, or doesn't play at all → You LOSE.
· Agent Insight: Always check the team sheet before placing! If a player doesn't start, the bet is usually void (check Fortebet rules). This is a fan-favorite bet.

3. First Goal Scorer

· The Core Concept: A higher-risk version. You are betting that a specific player will score the first goal of the match. If another player scores first, your bet loses—even if your player scores later.
· How It Works: Odds are higher than "Anytime." Some books offer "Last Goal Scorer" as well.
· Key Rule: If the player you select does not start the match, bets are typically void. If no goals are scored, bets are also void.
