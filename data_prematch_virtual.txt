3. Operator Procedures: Cancelling Bets

Operators can cancel a bet in three ways:

1. Cancel Last: Void the most recently placed bet.
2. Scan Barcode & Cancel: Scan the ticket's barcode to cancel it.
3. Enter Code Manually: Input a ticket's code to cancel it.

Procedure for Failed Ticket Print

If a ticket fails to print, the operator must report it in the designated ForteBet issue group on WhatsApp with the following details:

· Branch Name
· POS ID
· Ticket Type
· Ticket ID
· Reason for Issue

The support team will then provide a 4-digit cancellation code via private message. The same reporting format applies to processing large winning tickets.

Important Rules:

· Operators cannot place bets on credit for customers. Funds must be fully deposited and confirmed before betting.
· A virtual sports ticket can be cancelled at any time, as long as no event on that ticket has started.
· Virtual sports tickets cannot be cancelled through the online customer platform; cancellation is an operator function.
