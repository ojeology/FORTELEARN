                    <h3>Welcome Bonus Overview</h3>
                    <p>The Welcome Bonus is a special incentive for new registered customers. It is calculated as 300% of their first deposit, with a maximum cap of ₦1,000,000.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Eligibility Criteria</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Must be a newly registered customer.</li>
                        <li>Bonus is triggered by the first successful deposit.</li>
                        <li>Account must be verified via email to claim certain rewards.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Qualifying Bet Conditions</h3>
                    <p>To transfer bonus funds to your main account, you must place qualifying bets:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Minimum Selections:</strong> At least 3 events on a single ticket.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum Odds:</strong> Total ticket odds must be 3.00 or higher.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Credit Mechanism</h3>
                    <p>For every qualifying bet placed, 2% of the stake amount is automatically moved from your Welcome Bonus account to your main (withdrawable) account. This happens regardless of whether the bet wins or loses.</p>
                    
                    <div class="tip-box" style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 5px solid #ffc107; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px;">
                        <strong>Important:</strong> Bonus funds expire 90 days after the initial deposit. Encourage customers to meet the wagering requirements early!

                    <h3>Essential Terminal Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>The POS terminal is the heart of branch operations. Operators must be proficient in handling both sports betting and virtual games.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Daily Setup Routine</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Hardware Check:</strong> Ensure the thermal printer has sufficient paper and is plugged in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Verify the internet signal strength. A weak connection can lead to "Ticket Pending" errors.</li>
                        <li><strong>Login:</strong> Use your authorized operator credentials. Never share your password.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Processing Bets</h3>
                    <p>When a customer presents a selection:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Double-check the event IDs and market selections.</li>
                        <li>Confirm the stake amount before finalizing.</li>
                        <li>Hand the printed ticket to the customer immediately.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Common Technical Tasks</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Paper Jam:</strong> Open the printer compartment and realign the roll.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reprinting:</strong> Use the "Last Ticket" function if a print failure occurs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Updates:</strong> Do not restart the terminal during an active software update.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="tip-box" style="background: #d1ecf1; border-left: 5px solid #0c5460; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px;">
                        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keeping the terminal clean and well-ventilated prevents overheating and performance lags.

            'Cashout': {
                subtitle: 'Professional Cashout Procedures',
                content: `
                    <h3>Understanding Cashout</h3>
                    <p>Cashout gives customers control over their bets. It allows them to take a guaranteed profit or minimize losses before the final whistle.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Availability Rules</h3>
                    <p>Cashout is available only for online tickets when:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All matches on the ticket have official live results.</li>
                        <li>Live odds are currently active for every selection.</li>
                        <li>The current odds for any event do not exceed 10.00.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The VIP Points Rule</h3>
                    <p>This is a critical rule for agents to explain. If a customer earned VIP points for placing the bet, they must still have at least that many points in their account to cash out. If the points were already spent, the cashout will be blocked.</p>

                    <h3>Calculation Formula</h3>
                    <p>Our system uses a transparent formula: <br><strong>(Potential Winnings ÷ Total Current Odds) - 1% Service Fee</strong></p>

                    <h3>Suspension Scenarios</h3>
                    <p>Cashout is temporarily paused if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An event is marked as 'Void'.</li>
                        <li>The game is near the final minutes where odds fluctuate rapidly.</li>
                        <li>A goal has just been scored and markets are being updated.</li>
                    </ul>

            },
