ForteBet Cashout: Complete Guide

What is Cashout?

Cashout is a dynamic betting feature that allows you to settle your bet before all events on your ticket are completed. Instead of waiting for the final outcomes, you can lock in a profit or minimize losses based on live match situations and current odds.

Key Benefits:

· Risk Management: Secure guaranteed returns when your bet is winning
· Loss Reduction: Cut potential losses when games aren't going as predicted
· Strategic Flexibility: React to live match developments (red cards, injuries, weather changes)
· Instant Access: Receive funds immediately rather than waiting for event completion

When Can I Cash Out?

Cashout availability depends on specific conditions being met simultaneously:

1. All Matches Must Have Official Live Status

· Each event on your ticket must be in-play (game has started but not finished)
· Pre-match or postponed events will disable cashout
· Events must be officially recognized as "live" by our trading team
· Note: Some events may be live but cashout-suspended due to critical moments (penalties, last minutes, etc.)

2. Current Odds Must Be Available for All Selections

· Our trading team must be actively pricing each selection
· If odds aren't being updated for any selection, cashout becomes unavailable
· This ensures fair, market-reflective cashout values

3. Dynamic Availability

· Cashout availability changes throughout events
· May become temporarily unavailable during:
  · Goals being reviewed by VAR
  · Penalty situations
  · Last 5 minutes of close matches
  · Technical issues with data feeds

Important Rule: VIP Points System

The VIP Points Requirement

To prevent exploitation of our rewards system, we enforce strict VIP points rules:

The Rule: If you received VIP points for placing a bet, you must maintain the same number of VIP points in your account to cash out that bet.

Why This Exists:

· Prevents Point Farming: Stops users from placing bets, earning VIP points, then immediately cashing out without risk
· Ensures Fair Play: Maintains integrity of our VIP rewards program
· Encourages Genuine Betting: Rewards users who let bets run to completion

How It Works:

1. You place a ₦10,000 bet and receive 100 VIP points as a reward
2. You use 50 VIP points on other rewards, leaving 50 in your account
3. You cannot cash out the ₦10,000 bet until you restore your VIP points to 100
4. Once you earn/gain back the 50 missing points, cashout becomes available

Key Operational Points

1. Platform Limitation

· Cashout is available only for online/mobile tickets
· Physical shop tickets cannot be cashed out
· Ensure your bet was placed through ForteBet online platforms

2. Condition Prerequisites

· All above conditions must be met simultaneously
· Partial fulfillment does not enable partial cashout
· System automatically checks conditions every 30 seconds

3. VIP Points Deduction

· When you cash out, VIP points are deducted immediately
· Deduction equals points earned from the original bet
· Points return to your account if bet ultimately loses

Fair Cashout: Transparent Calculation

Our Market-First Transparent System

We're the first in the market to offer fully transparent cashout calculations. Unlike competitors who use opaque algorithms, we show you exactly how your cashout value is determined.

The Calculation Formula:

```
Cashout Value = (Potential Winnings ÷ Total Current Odds) - 1% Processing Fee
```

Understanding Each Component:

Potential Winnings: Your total return if all remaining selections win

```
Example: ₦1,000 bet at 10.00 odds = ₦10,000 potential winnings
```

Total Current Odds: Live combined odds of all remaining selections

```
Example: If original 10.00 odds drop to 5.00 due to match developments
```

1% Processing Fee: Small charge for instant settlement service

```
Example: ₦100 fee on ₦10,000 cashout value
```

Verification Process:

You can manually verify your cashout value:

1. Check current live odds of each remaining selection
2. Multiply these odds together for "Total Current Odds"
3. Divide your potential winnings by this number
4. Subtract 1% from the result
5. Compare with displayed cashout value

Example Walkthrough:

Original Bet: ₦1,000 on 3 matches @ 2.00 × 3.00 × 1.80 = 10.80 odds
Potential Winnings: ₦1,000 × 10.80 = ₦10,800

Current Situation:

· Match 1: Won (odds 2.00)
· Match 2: In-play, current odds 1.50 (was 3.00)
· Match 3: In-play, current odds 1.20 (was 1.80)

Current Total Odds: 1.50 × 1.20 = 1.80
Cashout Calculation: (₦10,800 ÷ 1.80) = ₦6,000
Minus 1% Fee: ₦6,000 - ₦60 = ₦5,940

Your Cashout Offer: ₦5,940

Fair Cashout Suspension Rules

Cashout is temporarily suspended in these specific scenarios:

1. Any Event Settled as Void

· If any selection on your ticket is declared void by the governing body
· System recalibrates the entire ticket
· Cashout remains suspended until:
  · Void event is officially resolved
  · New odds are calculated for remaining selections
  · All conditions are rechecked

2. Current Odds Exceed 10.00

· When live odds for any single selection rise above 10.00
· Reason: Extreme odds indicate highly volatile or unusual match situations
· Protects both users and ForteBet from market anomalies
· Cashout resumes when odds stabilize below 10.00 threshold

3. All Odds Unchanged from Original

· If current odds for all remaining selections haven't moved
· Indicates: No significant match developments or pricing updates
· Cashout becomes available when at least one selection's odds change
· Ensures cashout values reflect actual match conditions

Strategic Cashout Considerations

When to Consider Cashout:

· Secure Profits: When your bet is winning but remaining matches are risky
· Minimize Losses: When early matches lose, but partial recovery is possible
· Capital Reallocation: When better betting opportunities emerge
· Uncertain Conditions: Weather changes, team news, or unexpected developments

When to Avoid Cashout:

· Strong Position: When all results are going as predicted
· Early Stages: When most matches haven't started or are in early phases
· Value Preservation: When cashout value doesn't reflect true probability
· VIP Points Considerations: When maintaining VIP status is important

Technical Notes

System Updates:

· Cashout values update every 10-15 seconds

Troubleshooting:

4. Contact support if issue persists: 0800 009 009 009

Remember: Cashout is a strategic tool, not a guaranteed feature. Use it wisely to enhance your betting experience while understanding its limitations and requirements. Always consider the VIP points implications before placing bets you might want to cash out early.
